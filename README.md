# Semantic-Segmentation-Using-Deep-Learning
Description –  This project aims to detect nuclei in microscopic images using semantic segmentation. 
The dataset was obtained from Data Science Bowl hosted by Kaggle.com. 
The dataset consisted of 670 segmented nuclei images and associated segmentation masks for each nucleus. 
The images presented variations in cell type, magnification, imaging modality (brightfield vs. fluorescence), and image size; the dataset was to designed to challenge an algorithm’s ability to generalize across these variations. 

Implementation -
•	Adapted and trained a U-Net-based Convolutional Neural Network to identify cell nuclei in microscopy images. 
•	Performed data-preprocessing in python. 
•	Applied and tuned the model to get desired results using tensorflow.
